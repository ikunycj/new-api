// This file implements the in-process counters behind the dashboard's realtime
// RPM / TPM cards.
//
// Design constraints, in priority order:
//
//  1. The relay hot path must not get slower. A request only takes a read lock
//     plus a handful of integer adds on memory that is already resident; there
//     is no allocation, no Redis round trip and no database write.
//  2. Nothing is persisted. The numbers describe the recent past only, so
//     losing them on restart is expected — the hourly quota_data rollup remains
//     the durable record and is what the dashboard's historical charts read.
//  3. Memory must be bounded. One fixed-size ring per user that has sent
//     traffic, reclaimed after a period of inactivity.
//
// The rings are per node. Each instance only sees the requests it served
// itself, so a multi-node deployment reports per-node throughput; the snapshot
// carries NodeName so a caller can tell which node answered.

const (
	// realtimeSlotSeconds is the resolution of the ring. One minute windows are
	// the shortest the dashboard asks for, so ten seconds leaves enough
	// granularity to react within a window without making the ring huge.
	realtimeSlotSeconds = 10

	// realtimeRetentionSeconds is how much history a ring holds. Six hours
	// covers the longest window plus a comfortable margin for the chart.
	realtimeRetentionSeconds = 6 * 60 * 60

	// realtimeSlotCount is the ring length. Each slot is 24 bytes, so one ring
	// costs ~52KB regardless of how much traffic the user generates.
	realtimeSlotCount = realtimeRetentionSeconds / realtimeSlotSeconds

	// realtimeIdleTTL is how long a user's ring survives without traffic before
	// the sweeper frees it. It matches the retention window on purpose: a ring
	// whose newest sample is older than that can no longer contribute to any
	// window the dashboard can ask for, so keeping it would only hold memory
	// for data that can never be read back.
	realtimeIdleTTL = realtimeRetentionSeconds * time.Second

	// realtimeSweepInterval is how often the sweeper runs.

	// cannot grow the map without bound by cycling through accounts; the value
	// is far above any realistic concurrent user count on a single node.
	realtimeMaxUsers = 20000

	// wasted payload, so points are summed into one-minute buckets.
